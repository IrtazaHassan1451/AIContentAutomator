    "text": "Warren Black with an urgent update. recession is showing concerning signals. The technical indicators I watch are flashing warning signs we haven't seen since 2007. Red flag number one: The Leading Economic Index has fallen for 10 consecutive months. This matters because this indicator has preceded every recession for the past 60 years. Second warning sign: Consumer sentiment and spending patterns are diverging. The implications? people say one thing in surveys but their credit card data shows something else entirely. Final indicator: Corporate earnings guidance is increasingly cautious for Q3 and Q4. My advice right now: Cash positions and defensive assets deserve your attention right now. Share this with someone who needs to hear it. Follow for more financial warnings.",
